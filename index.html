		<!-- Introduction -->
		<p id="introduction"><em>A research report by Caitlin Macleod for ANU DESN1001 Semester 1 2017.</em></p>

		<p>Amy Wibowo (@sailorhg) is a software engineer who combines interests in art and technology to influence her computer science zines, illustrations and conference talks. In 2015 she launched BubbleSort <a href="#" class="tooltip-definition" title="Zines are small, often hand-made, 'magazines', typically involved in the crafty scene.">Zines</a>, a series of hand-drawn art, stories and projects to explain computer science concepts to a target audience of high-school girls,. She speaks regularly at tech conferences, schools and local meetups about her creative projects and experiences as a woman of colour in tech, and has also launched and designed several online projects, like <a href="http://witchy.co">Luna</a> and <a href="http://sailorhg.github.io/legoizer/">Legoizer</a>.</p>
		
		<p>Wibowo uses many platforms to present and document her creations, and her larger projects also have their own online presence. Her <a href="http://sailorhg.com">website</a> only links to a few services, like her twitter, blog and photo gallery. You can see a list of the sources this report uses in the <a href="#references">References section</a>.</p>

		<h3 id="comparisons">Comparable makers</h3>

		<p>I found three similar makers:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Julia Evans, a Canadian engineer who creates zines, graphics, blog posts and conference talks explaining computer concepts;</li>
			<li>Lea Verou, a CSS experimenter, professional speaker and human-computer interaction researcher at MIT; and</li>
			<li>Sarah McNeil, an Australian illustrator and zine creator.</li>
		</ul>

		<!-- Presenting section -->
		<h2 id="presenting">Presenting</h2>

		<p>Wibowo has several types of content that she presents to her followers, which are usually linked centrally from her main engagement platform, Twitter. A consistent feature of most creations when she presents them to her followers is that they have a cute pastel preview picture, which is sometimes a photo and sometimes an illustration of her own creation.</p>

		<p>With the wide variety of things that Wibowo creates, they're in a lot of different places and thus presented in a variety of ways. Her writing and conference talks are typically hosted on Medium with her own illustrations. Bubblesort zines and are presented on the <a href="https://bubblesort-zines.myshopify.com/">Bubblesort Zines shop site</a> and announced on Twitter, often with a picture of the zine itself surrounded by cutesy objects. She also posts standalone illustrations for special occasions or where commissioned, like the Stranger Things-themed Valentine's Day illustration below.</p>

		<h3>Presenting comparison - Julia Evans (@b0rk)</h3>

		<p>A similar maker is Julia Evans, particularly in the way she posts small cartoons explaining key computing concepts on Twitter. The images attached to her content are usually just the cartoons, with no surroundings.</p>

		<p>Julia Evans also presents her work in tech conferences, similar to how Wibowo has presented her knitting and origami talks. Evans hands out free copies of her related zines at her talks, but I think the key difference there is that Evans still has a full-time job and does her creation on the side, while Wibowo is pursuing her creations as a full-time occupation.</p>

		<!-- Documenting Section -->
		<h2 id="documenting">Documenting</h2>

		<p>Amy Wibowo's social media feed is usually focused on documenting her own life and opinions, as well as linking to her new projects. She often mentions the work that she's doing, but usually incidentally or when asking her followers for feedback.</p>

			<figcaption>A collection of tweets from @sailorhg showing documenting of creations</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<p>A key place where Wibowo has documented progress on a project is in the progress update section of the original BubbleSort Zines kickstarter, which had 36 updates throughout its lifetime. Part of this was because the project was episodic, with each zine being designed and sent out seperately. Some of these updates are shown below.</p>

		<!-- Engaging Section -->
		<h2 id="engaging">Engaging</h2>

		<p>Wibowo's key engagement with followers is through Twitter, and takes the form of a prolific amount of tweets on most topics in her life. Followers see everything from life stories (engagement, moving buildings, copious pictures of trips) to updates on recent projects and requests for input on potential directions to move in.</p>

		<p>A particular example is her tweet below, announcing that she has created a Patreon where fans can financially support her creations. Unlike many creators who depend on Patreon for day-to-day expenses, she hasn't really promoted it beyond a couple of tweets and only has a few backers.</p>

		<figure><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">💖 btw! i made a patreon if you&#39;d like to support the unpaid work i do (writing, weird art projects, etc.) <a href="https://t.co/tOw4D028ni">https://t.co/tOw4D028ni</a> 💖</p>&mdash; sailor mercury (@sailorhg) <a href="https://twitter.com/sailorhg/status/839572231835418624">March 8, 2017</a></blockquote></figure>

		<!-- Adapting Section -->
		<h2 id="adapting">Adapting</h2>

		<p>Amy Wibowo's ability to create and present information to the public was greatly affected by the popularity of the original <strong>BubbleSort Zines kickstarter</strong>. Since it was originally intended to be aimed at highschool girls, she wasn't anticipating the huge interest that generates for many women-in-STEM initiatives. The kickstarter was funded in the first 4 hours and raised $17,000 in its first day (<a href="https://kickstarter.com/projects/sailorhg/bubblesort-computer-science-zines/posts/1176673">see the first kickstarter update here</a>).</p>

		<p>Throughout the process of the original kickstarter, Wibowo set stretch goals at $20k (a video for backers showing the process of creating a zine from start to finish), $30k (video tutorial components for the hardware hacking and circuit zines), $40k (1 additional zine), $50k (yearly subscriptions available for 6 more zines) and $60k (a <a href="https://bubblesort-zines.myshopify.com">website with additional resources and tutorials</a>). All of these stretch goals were reached and the kickstarter finished with <strong>$60431 pledged from 1,153 backers</strong> where it was originally aiming for $10,000.</p>

		<p>Cultural support for initiatives to support more women in STEM boosted the audience of Wibowo's creations to a much bigger base than she perhaps expected, and she performed admirably in coming up with achievable stretch goals as they became likely.</p>

		<p>More mundane ways that Wibowo's practice was affected by the internet include the presentation of her creations to optimise for image-favouring social media sites like <strong>Twitter and Instagram</strong>. Twitter users usually engage more with image-accompanied content, which Wibowo definitely adapted to with the way she announces important updates (see the majority of tweets shown in the <a href="#presenting">Presenting section</a>).</p>

		<p><a href="https://instagram.com/sailorhg">Her Instagram posts</a> are another example of adaptation (or not) in Wibowo's portfolio. She posts beautiful photos of travelling, food, plush toys and her creative work which are carefully composed and shot, with descriptive descriptions. However, Wibowo doesn't include hashtags in the majority of her instagram posts, which is a common feature of that platform to boost audience size.</p>

			<figcaption>During her second Kickstarter, SailorHg posted about her passion for creating a cute candy-like electronics kit.</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<p>Another content form which shows SailorHg's obvious adaptation to online form is <a href="https://medium.com/@sailorhg">Medium-hosted content</a>. Wibowo primarily uses the popular writing platform to share written versions of conference talks after presenting to one or more conferences, like AlterConf and <a href="http://osfeels.com">Open Source and Feelings</a>.</p>

		<p>Because her Medium posts are usually based on talks, Wibowo includes her own illustrations at regular points during the articles, breaking them up into a much more visual journey than used to be available in a written article. This is also a sign of specific adaptation to Medium as a technical platform as adding pictures to articles is a much more user-friendly process than it used to be on platforms like Blogspot and Wordpress.</p>

		<!-- Conclusion -->
		<h2 id="analyse">Analyse and evaluate</h2>

		<p>Amy Wibowo's creations, for all that they're now acting as her full-time occupation, still seem like more of a side-effect of her personality and existence on the Internet. Most of her public engagement seems to be as part of an ongoing conversation on minorities in technology and advocating for the inclusion of arts and humanities in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths) educations.</p>

		<p>In comparison to the other three creators examined here, Wibowo's approach to online presence is much more eclectic and undirected. When I was searching for SailorHg's individual projects I had to do a lot of digging through her Twitter timeline, whereas Lea Verou, Julia Evans and Sarah McNeil all took a lot of care in maintaining their personal homepage as an index and host to the majority of their work.</p>
